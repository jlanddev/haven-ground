    detailedDescription: "Our Nashboro Village is coming in 2027, and it's going to redefine what community means around here.\n\nThese thirty townhomes we're putting up aren't just structures to fill space. They're going to be three stories of real homes where families will gather, where kids will leave their handprints on walls, where life's moments - both ordinary and extraordinary - will unfold day after day.\n\nI'm particularly proud of the restaurant space we've designed. It'll be the kind of place where you don't just eat, you experience. Where conversations flow as easily as the wine. Where the chef might come out to your table not because it's policy, but because they genuinely want to know what you thought of that new dish they've been perfecting.\n\nAround that, our 13,000 square feet of commercial space will bring the right kind of energy - shops that serve a purpose, that add something meaningful to daily life. Places worth walking to, worth spending time in.\n\nAnd that 12-acre park? That's the heart of it all. That's our commitment to creating something bigger than just buildings. It's green space where community actually happens - where dogs run until they're happily exhausted, where kids climb trees, where you might strike up a conversation with a neighbor that turns into a friendship spanning years. Those 1,500 feet of sidewalks aren't just pathways; they're connections, linking everything together.\n\nEven our approach to the land itself tells you something about what we value. Those pervious pavers and bioretention systems show we're thinking about tomorrow, not just today.\n\nOur Nashboro Village is coming in 2027. We're building it right, building it to last, building it for life as it should be lived.\n\nWorth the wait. Worth calling home.",
