Cattle graze the pastures, and native grasses and wildflowers, including bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush, grow throughout the area. The property is surrounded on three sides by Gates Ranch, a 1,500-acre community of family farms and ranches that will be the surrounding forever. Each homesite offers approximately two acres with a mix of open pasture and tree cover, providing various options for building placement. We were grateful to work with the Andrews family in acquiring this piece of land. Washington County was incredible to work with, and the team at Hodde Surveying handled all the engineering work for Oak Hill Reserve."
